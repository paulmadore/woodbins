# woodbins
A script to enable the express installation and setting up of a full Woodcore node. 

# One Way You Can Use This Script

For this tutorial we will be assuming you choose to use Linode. The commands will be the same on other installations. For the purposes of this exact script, you must use Ubuntu 18.04, due to dependency issues. Binaries are fickle; the reason for using a script is that the machine will find its own way to do things.

If you do not already have a Linode, the $5 option will work. You should get some credit using the following [link](https://www.linode.com/?r=ad9d5e56693cc72029a281562620c62c5575f4bf). The following images demonstrate the process:

## 1

Clone this repository or download the script the machine. You need to make it executable using:

```chmod +x woodbins.sh```

## 2 Run the Script

```./woodbins.sh```

## 3 Watch the Screen

You may have to agree to let some services restart.

# Another Way You Can Use This Script

You can also build your own version of Woodcoin and serve it. The script will help you quickly install the dependencies and other things you will need on your miniature woodcoin network.

Now watch this video, and see how this can save you hours of compile time -- just 5 minutes, even with buggy 1.0.
